## Neat Conky By SS7

Neat, Rick & Morty based conky theme for your Linux desktop.

Currently works with nvidia graphics card only. I am trying to add intel as well. I dont have AMD so cant be sure If I did it correctly so I wish I could get some help. Contributers are welcomed.

Sorry for putting my signature in there at last. Couldnt come up with an ending line. Hope you will do better. You can change it by editing signature.txt.

### How to change signature(last line of theme)?
Initially it was hard coded. Now onwards it will read the first line as status from file signature.txt included in the folder. 
To change it simply put a text you want to show. You can use your script to generate the text file.
It refreshes once every 10 min. You can change the refresh rate by editing "Time" file.


Customization of Jesse Time Conky theme. But I think I added too much to call it just a customization now.
